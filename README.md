# Feature Check List (Lab 4)

I made two cubes that act as mission objectives.

I made a trigger so when the player goes to the first cube, the HUD text updates.

I made a trigger so when the player goes to the second cube and presses E, a fire starts.

I added HUD text that always tells the player what to do next.

I added animations for the player and the ability to jump.

The triggers only happen once so nothing repeats.

The mission can be completed start to finish in under a minute.

# Directions

Use WASD to move and the Mouse to look around.

Press Space to jump.

Press E at the second cube to start the fire and finish the mission.

Follow the HUD prompts to know which cube to go to next.
